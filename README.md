# Megamaser-Cosmology-Project
The Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP) is an NRAO Key Science Project to measure the Hubble Constant, H0, by determining geometric distances 
to circumnuclear 22 GHz H2O megamasers in galaxies well into the Hubble flow. In combination with the recent, exquisite observations of the 
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by WMAP and Planck, these measurements provide a direct test of the standard cosmological model and constrain 
the equation of state of dark energy. The MCP has so far determined H0 = 69.3 ± 4.2 km/s/Mpc from published observations of 
UGC 3789 (Reid et al. 2013), NGC 6264 (Kuo et al. 2013), NGC 6323 (Kuo et al. 2015) and NGC 5765b (Gao et al. 2015). 
Work on other galaxies is in progress, and we expect to achieve a 4% or better measurement of H0 when the project is completed around the 
end of 2017. Our measurement so far is intermediate between the Planck prediction of H0 in the context of the standard cosmological model 
(H0 = 67.8 ± 0.9 km/s/Mpc; Ade et al. 2015) and recent measurements based on standard candles (H0 = 74 ± 2.5 km/s/Mpc).
